# Teleport & Collection
Uses A-frame 1.3.0
This file combines successfully for Head Mounted Displays (HMD) Teleport (aframe-teleport-controls) & Collection (aframe-super-hands-component). The Super-hands component uses the sphere-collider from aframe-extras. This also works as a desktop file using the cursor & mouse to 'click' on selectable objects.

The navmesh component is care of Ada Rose Cannon's simple-navmesh-constraint because the nav-mesh in aframe-extras is still broken (Dec. 13th, 2022).

A copy of this file is being used to develop a UI system for the 'game'/tutorial file Submariner Walkabout.
